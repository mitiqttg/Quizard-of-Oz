## Online deployment:

## Local deployment: Starting and shutting down

The application runs locally with Docker Compose.

- To start the application, open up the terminal in the folder that
  contains the `docker-compose.yml` file, in my case, you can right click on wsd-walking-skeleton-main, 
  choose ```Open in Intergrated Terminal ```,<br> 
  then type ```docker-compose up``` to terminal, click Enter and wait for a long bit (usually on the first start)<br>
  Finally, go to "http://localhost:7777/" to experience the application. You can access as admin  with the email ```admin@admin.com``` and password ```123456```. Otherwise, register as new user and login with your own credentials.

- To stop the application, press `ctrl+C` (or similar) in the same terminal
  where you wrote the command ```docker-compose up```. Another option is to open up
  a new terminal and navigate to the folder that contains the
  ```docker-compose.yml``` file, and then write ```docker-compose stop```.

## E2E Tests with playwright

To test the application locally, you must first launch the application by docker as the above instructions.
To run E2E tests, go to the same root as when you launch the project above, using the following command:
```docker-compose run --entrypoint=npx e2e-playwright playwright test```<br>
